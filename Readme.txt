Legend for the Weather Data
TMAX (Maximum Daily Air Temperature): Highest 5-minute averaged temperature observation reported each day.
TMIN (Minimum Daily Air Temperature): Lowest 5-minute averaged temperature observation reported each day.
TAVG (Average Air Temperature): Average of all 5-minute averaged temperature observations each day.
DAVG (Average Dewpoint Temperature): Average of all 5-minute averaged dewpoint temperatures each day. Dewpoint temperature is derived from 1.5m air temperature and the corresponding humidity value.
HMAX (Maximum Humidity): Highest 5-minute averaged humidity observation reported each day.
HMIN (Minimum Humidity): Lowest 5-minute averaged humidity observation reported each day.
HAVG (Average Humidity): Average of all 5-minute averaged humidity observations each day.
PDIR (Primary Wind Direction): Most common wind direction for the day based on 16-point compass heading (i.e., 0 is N; 1 is NNE; 15 is NNW).
PDFQ (Primary Wind Direction Frequency): Frequency of observations in the given wind direction category.
SDIR (Secondary Wind Direction): Second most common wind direction for the day based on 16-point compass heading.
SDFQ (Secondary Wind Direction Frequency): Frequency of observations in the given wind direction category.
WSMX (Maximum Wind Speed): Highest 5-minute averaged 10m wind speed measurement each day.
WSMN (Minimum Wind Speed): Lowest 5-minute averaged 10m wind speed measurement each day.
WSPD (Average Wind Speed): Average of all 5-minute wind speed observations each day.
WDEV (Standard Deviation of Wind Speed at 10m): Standard deviation of the wind speed at 10m during a 5-minute observation period.
WMAX (Maximum Wind Gust): Highest 3-second wind speed measurement each day.
2AVG (Average Wind Speed at 2m): Average of all 5-minute 2m wind speed observations each day.
2DEV (Standard Deviation of Wind Speed at 2m): Standard deviation of the wind speed at 2m during a 5-minute observation period.
PMAX (Maximum Station Pressure): Highest 5-minute averaged station air pressure observation each day.
PMIN (Minimum Station Pressure): Lowest 5-minute averaged station air pressure observation each day.
PAVG (Average Station Pressure): Average of all 5-minute averaged station air pressure observations each day.
MSLP (Mean Sea Level Pressure): Average of all 5-minute averaged station air pressure observations adjusted for station elevation each day.
RAIN (Rain): Liquid precipitation measured each day.  Frozen precipitation cannot be recorded until it melts; therefore, precipitation from snow may not be recorded until several days after the snow event.
HMAXO (Maximum Daily Humidity Observation Number): Daily observation number that measured highest 5-minute averaged humidity each day.
HMINO (Minimum Daily Humidity Observation Number): Daily observation number that measured lowest 5-minute averaged humidity each day.
